⚡ Connection Diagram — Description
Here’s how your components are connected:

1️⃣ ESP8266 NodeMCU
NodeMCU Pin	Connected To	Notes
D1 (GPIO5)	1kΩ resistor → 2N2222 base	Controls 2N2222 switching
D2 (GPIO4)	LED + resistor (220-330Ω) → GND	Status LED
GND	Common GND	Shared with MOSFET, 2N2222
3V3 or external power	Blynk + logic power	Power for NodeMCU

2️⃣ 2N2222 NPN Transistor
2N2222 Pin	Connected To	Notes
Base	From NodeMCU D1 via 1kΩ resistor	Controls transistor
Collector	MOSFET Gate (IRF510)	Drives gate
Emitter	GND	Common ground

3️⃣ IRF510 MOSFET
IRF510 Pin	Connected To	Notes
Gate	2N2222 collector	Controlled by 2N2222
